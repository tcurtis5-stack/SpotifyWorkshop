## Project Overview

SpotifyWorkshop is a mixed-methods exploration of personal Spotify listening data,
designed to investigate how behavioral patterns in listening frequency, genre shifts,
and repetition reflect changes in context, emotion, and user intent.

This project combines:
- Quantitative analysis of listening history (frequency, trends, distributions)
- Qualitative interpretation of behavioral patterns
- Visual storytelling to translate data into human-centered insights

The goal is to demonstrate how small analytical insights can meaningfully influence
product decisions and user experience. 

## Why This Matters

Understanding how users interact with music over time provides insight into
how small product decisions — such as playlist length, recommendation timing,
or surfaced content — can influence discovery, retention, and emotional engagement.

This project reflects how mixed-methods research can bridge quantitative signals
with qualitative meaning to inform user-centered product decisions.

## Methods & Tools

- Data processing and analysis in R  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Time-series visualization  
- Comparative analysis across playlists, artists, and listening contexts  
- Behavioral pattern identification and interpretation  
- Qualitative inference layered on quantitative signals  
- RMarkdown for reproducible research and narrative reporting
